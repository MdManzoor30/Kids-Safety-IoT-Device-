# Kids-Safety-IoT-Device
This project focuses on developing a Kids Safety IoT Device designed to address child safety concerns during school commutes and outdoor activities. We developed device for BRR Technology, utilises an Arduino UNO board with GPS and GSM modules to enable real-time child location tracking. Parents can request the child's exact location via SMS, helping mitigate risks like road accidents, kidnapping, and harassment. The prototype uses a GPRS shield to send live location updates, with key components including an Arduino UNO REV3, GPRS Shield SIM 5320A, and micro SIM. While the current version has limitations such as potential tracking difficulties in bad weather and communication lags in fast-moving vehicles, the team envisions future improvements like adding an emergency button, incorporating health monitoring features (heart rate, temperature), and making the device more compact and user-friendly.
